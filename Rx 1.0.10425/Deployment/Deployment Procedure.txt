Targets

	CodePlex

	You must request the API key from a project coordinator to deploy to this location.

Procedure

Building the solution in Release mode automatically creates deployment packages 
for CodePlex and NuGet, but it does not deploy them.  Follow these instructions
to build these packages and then verify and deploy them manually.

	1. Switch to Release mode in Visual Studio.
	2. Build the entire solution.
	3. Run all unit tests and expect "green" for all results.
	4. Run the console labs to verify stability and smoke test.
		 a. Set Rxx.Labs as the start-up project and press Ctrl+F5.
		 b. Execute various labs and check their output manually.
	5. Examine the NuGet package for correctness.
		 a. Location: Deployment\Rxx\Release\{Date}_{Time}\NuGet\
	6. Examine Rxx.zip for correctness.
		 a. Location: Deployment\Rxx\Release\{Date}_{Time}\CodePlex\
	7. Examine Rxx.Labs.zip for correctness.
		 a. Location: Deployment\Rxx\Release\{Date}_{Time}\CodePlex\
	8. Update the latest release notes in the Artifacts folder.
	9. Check-in all pending changes.
	10. Add the latest release notes to the top of the Release Notes wiki on CodePlex.
		  a. http://rxx.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Release%20Notes
	11. Deploy both .zip files to CodePlex.
	12. Run the NuGetPush.bat script to deploy the NuGet package.
		  a. You can simply double-click this .bat file in Windows Explorer.
			b. It’s located in the same folder as the NuGet package file.


...and don't forget to let people know about the deployment.
