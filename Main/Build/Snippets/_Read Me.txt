Snippets

	We use IntelliSense code snippets to simplify development.  Snippets allow us to encapsulate 
	common coding patterns into simple keywords that are easy to remember and use.

Installation

	All of our snippets are located under the solution's Build\Snippets\ folder.

	After you install the snippets you can begin using them without restarting Visual Studio.

	Once installed, these snippets are available for use in any solution, not just this one.
	
	To install our snippets: 

		1. Select the menu item: Tools > Code Snippets Manager...
		2. Click the "Import..." button at the bottom.
		3. Browse to our solution's snippets folder on your computer.
			 a. For example: C:\Projects\Rxx\Main\Build\Snippets\
		4. Select all of the .snippet files that you would like to import.  Click Open.
		5. On the right side, select a target installation folder.
			 a. This is optional.  You can use the default location: "My Code Snippets"
		6. Click Finish.
		7. If you want to verify installation, then do not close the Code Snippets Manager.

	To verify snippet installation: 

		1. Open the Code Snippets Manager (see above).
		2. Select "Visual C#" from the Language drop down (assuming the snippet targets C#).
		3. Expand the "My Code Snippets" folder and look for the installed snippets.
